The original Victory mPos system as developed while working at [Vectra](http://vectra.co.za).

The idea behind the project was to take the original version created in Ionic 3 and to update it to not only use the latest version of Ionic with Capacitor, but also to update & improve the code base as a whole. Creating a new coding standard that will make the project easier to work on and easier to learn as new developers join the team.

## Overall goals of the project:
- Implement the Mobile App using the latest mobile technologies.
- Refactor the code to be simpler and more streamlined.
- Streamline the business rules.

### What I will be doing:
  - Implementing a coding standard that is easy to follow and easy to understand.
  - Refactor the existing code base to not be as convoluted.
  - Implement better practices taking into account the best standards for developing mobile apps.
  - Tweaking the UI/UX to accommodate the the new framework version

### What I won't be doing:
- Reinventing the wheel.
- Overhauling the UI/UX.
- Re-implementing all the existing business logic.

The motivation behind the update of the Mobile app outside of normal business hours is 2 fold. Firstly, it is a great way to learn and upskill myself in the latest version of the Ionic Framework. Secondly, at some point the system will not be as maintainable using older technologies so it will need to be updated. This way I can get a bit head start.
